WARNING: [Route 35-514] Design has a large number of hold violators. This is likely a design or constraint issue. Router is turning off hold fixing.
Resolution: Review and update your design or constraints to reduce pre-route hold violations. You can disable hold expansion based bailout to continue fixing hold using the following TCL command in a pre-route TCL script: set_param route.enableHoldExpnBailout 0. This can incur potentially very long router run time.
